# Shell Operator
 Locally run shell operator that triggers when pods are updated.

 Before running the operator (and setting up RBAC), you need to create a namespace with `kubectl create namespace test`

### RBAC Update:
The clusterrolebinding now works in the shell-operator-rbac.yaml file. clusterRoleBinding.yaml can be ignored.
